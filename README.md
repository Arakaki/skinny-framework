# Skinny Framework 

Skinny is a full-stack web app framework, which is built on [Scalatra](http://scalatra.org) and additional components are integrated. 

To put it simply, Skinny framework's concept is **Scala on Rails**. Skinny is highly inspired by [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) and it is optimized for sustainable productivity for ordinary Servlet-based app development.
